# Piwik Advanced Online Marketing Plugin 

With the Piwik AOM plugin you can integrate data like campaign names, ad impressions, costs etc. from advertising 
platforms such as Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing, Criteo, Facebook Ads and Taboola into Piwik and combine that data 
with individual visits. 

Work with this valuable data directly in the Piwik UI or use the AOM plugin's API to export data to your data warehouse. 
Perform customer journey analysis or evaluate your online marketing's performance when applying different conversion 
attribution models.
